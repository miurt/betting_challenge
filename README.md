A betting_challenge application for Check24 challenge (app to bet on sports, UEFA Euro 2024 in this example).

- Python, flet and firebase for the database

--Python and Flet was chosen, since the UI wasn't the main goal of this challenge and Flet lets the devs to create multi-platform apps powered by Flutter.

--Flet also has in-build solutions for broadcasting messages to all the app instances.

--Firebase was chosen as an easy and free (in this case) solution for the DB, which can potentially handle lots of requests and users.




I will add the video till Wednesday 06.06 :)
Currently dashboard is not completely implemented, will be added on Tuesday, still some bugs are present, will be fixed before Wednesday

To run the app:

```
flet run [app_directory]
```
